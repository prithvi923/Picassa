Impressions:

Part 1 did a good job of setting me up in that I understood the code pretty well
as well as was able to think more critically of what kind design I would have to use
to implement the new functionalities. Because of my design in Part 1, the changes
I needed to make were not hard to write design-wise, although the particular
functionalities that needed to be implemented required thinking to achieve.
